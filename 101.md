# NIP-101: Decentralized Trust System for Nostr

## Abstract

This NIP proposes a **Decentralized Trust System** for the Nostr protocol, allowing users to enhance their social feed experience by filtering content based on trust ratings. The system mirrors real-world trust relationships, helping reduce spam, trolling, and misinformation without central control or opaque algorithms.

## Motivation

While Nostr's decentralized architecture empowers users, it also lacks a scalable, decentralized moderation mechanism. The current reliance on manual blocklists and follow lists is limited. This NIP introduces a trust-based model that enhances feed quality by prioritizing content from trusted individuals and networks.

## Specification

### 1. New Event Kind: `Trust Rating` (Kind 33)

A new event kind is introduced to facilitate trust ratings:

- **Event structure:**
  ```json
  {
     "kind": 33,
     "content": "", // Content remains empty
     "tags": [
        ["p", "public key of the user being rated"],
        ["rating", "numerical value between -100 and 100"],
        ["e", "id of triggering event (optional)"],
        ["category", "trust category (optional)"],
        ["lang", "language (optional)"]
     ],
     "pubkey": "public key of the rater",
     "sig": "signature of the rater"
  }
  ```

- **Field Descriptions:**
  - `kind`: Event kind (33 for trust ratings).
  - `content`: Unused; remains an empty string.
  - `tags`: Contains trust-related metadata:
    - `["p", "<target_pubkey>"]`: The public key of the user being rated.
    - `["rating", "<-100 to 100>"]`: The numerical trust rating.
    - `["e", "<event_id>"]` (optional): The ID of the event triggering the rating.
    - `["category", "<category>"]` (optional): An optional trust category for context.
    - `["lang", "<language>"]` (optional): An optional language for category.
  - `pubkey`: The public key of the user issuing the trust rating.
  - `sig`: The cryptographic signature of the event, ensuring authenticity.


### 2. Trust Calculation (Client-Side)

Trust scores are calculated dynamically based on direct and indirect relationships:

- **Direct ratings:** The score provided directly by the user.
- **Indirect ratings:** Calculated using:

![](https://ipfs.copylaradio.com/ipfs/QmPtQxDk8pc8aGBwWNs38nTVP2Zg8Cb8Ag9s4xb35NtL93)

```trust(B) = Square_Root(trust(A,B) * trust(User,A))```

- **trust(A,B)**: Trust rating given by user ( A ) to ( B ).
- **trust(User,A)**: Trust rating given by the current User to ( A ).
- Negative ratings are ignored for indirect calculations.
- Trust is averaged if multiple paths exist between users.

Users can configure the depth of the trust network (friends, friends of friends, etc.) and thresholds for ratings.

### 3. Feed Filtering (Client-Side)

- Users define a trust threshold (e.g., -100 to 100) for displaying events.
- Content from users below the threshold is hidden by default, with an option to explore hidden content.

### 4. User Interface

Clients implementing this system should provide:
- **Trust/Distrust Buttons**: For rating users or content.
- **Trust Scores**: Displayed for users, configurable by category.
- **Import/Export Tools**: To manage trust lists.
- **Trust Network Visualization**: Interactive diagrams to understand trust relationships.

## Rationale

- **Decentralization:** Users manage their trust network without relying on centralized entities.
- **Transparency:** All ratings are public and verifiable.
- **Customization:** Each user can tailor their experience to their preferences.
- **Real-world analogy:** Mirrors trust in real-life relationships, fostering organic moderation.

## Compatibility

This system integrates seamlessly with existing Nostr clients by introducing a new event kind. Clients not implementing it will simply ignore Kind 33 events.

## Potential Applications

- **Spam Reduction:** Filter out spam and low-quality content.
- **Personalized Feeds:** Prioritize relevant and meaningful content.
- **Community Building:** Create shared trust networks for specific groups.
- **News Verification:** Utilize trusted entities for fact-checking and labeling.

## Security and Privacy

- **Integrity:** Trust ratings are signed by their authors, ensuring authenticity.
- **Public Nature:** Ratings are public by design. Users retain control over how they interpret and use these ratings.

## Advantages

- **Decentralized Moderation:** No central authority required.
- **Scalability:** The trust system grows organically with the network.
- **Resilience:** Hard for bad actors to manipulate due to multiple trust layers.

## Disadvantages

- **Echo Chambers:** Users might over-filter their feeds, reducing diversity.
- **Complexity:** Requires education to prevent misuse or bias-driven ratings.

## Alternatives

- **Blocklists:** Effective for basic use but lack flexibility for nuanced moderation.
- **Follow Lists:** Useful but limited for filtering unknown users.

This system enhances these approaches by creating an organic, decentralized trust network.

### Python Demo Code

```python
import math

def calculate_trust(target_user, friend_ratings, all_ratings):
    """
    Calculate the trust score for a target user based on direct and indirect trust ratings.

    Args:
        target_user (str): The public key of the user whose trust score is being calculated.
        friend_ratings (dict): Direct trust ratings given by the current user to their friends.
        all_ratings (dict): A nested dictionary containing trust ratings between all users (e.g., friend-of-friend ratings).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated trust score for the target user.
    """
    trust_score = 0.0
    weight_sum = 0.0

    for friend, direct_rating in friend_ratings.items():
        if friend in all_ratings and target_user in all_ratings[friend]:
            mutual_rating = all_ratings[friend][target_user]
            if mutual_rating > 0:  # Ignore negative ratings for this calculation
                weighted_trust = direct_rating * mutual_rating
                trust_score += weighted_trust
                weight_sum += abs(direct_rating)  # Weight contributions by the strength of direct trust

    if weight_sum == 0:
        return 0.0  # No valid trust path to target user
    return math.sqrt(trust_score / weight_sum)


# Example Data
all_ratings = {
    "tom": {  # Tom's direct ratings
        "alice": 80,
        "mike": 50
    },
    "alice": {  # Alice's ratings of others
        "jeremy": 30,
        "sophie": -10,
        "dave": 15
    },
    "mike": {  # Mike's ratings of others
        "jeremy": 20,
        "sophie": 25
    }
}

# Direct ratings from Tom
friend_ratings = all_ratings["tom"]

# Calculate trust scores for specific users
for user in ["jeremy", "sophie", "dave"]:
    trust = calculate_trust(user, friend_ratings, all_ratings)
    print(f"Tom's calculated trust score for {user}: {trust:.2f}")

```

### Extended Formula and Use Cases

**The formula `trust(B)=math.sqrt(trust(A,B)√ótrust(User,A))` is intended as a simple example for calculating trust.**
Clients are not bound to use this algorithm but are encouraged to use the kind 33 to build their own custom models.
The following extended section is intended to showcase the potential of using the kind 33 event,
and illustrate how clients could customize the formula or take into account other factors.

**Use Case 1: Personalized Feed Filtering**

In a typical social media scenario, users may wish to prioritize content from specific trusted users.
Clients can implement the above formula, but also adjust the way trust is calculated or displayed:

-   **Category:** Use `category="friend"` to compute the trust only using close friends.
-   **Depth:** Limit calculation to one degree of separation (direct friends) for increased relevance and decreased network weight.
-   **Boost:** Boost users who frequently interact with the current user by adding +10 for each reply, +20 for each like, +50 for every zap. The score must be capped at 100.
-   **UX:** Clients could use a simplified "Trust Signal" system, as displayed below.

| Mood Level      | Meaning                      | Trust Value (Internal) |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| ‚ù§Ô∏è Love       | Fully trust & endorse      | `+100`               |
| üòä Positive   | Positive opinion           | `+50`                |
| üëç Like       | Good opinion               | `+25`                |
| üòê Distrust   | Cautious, minor distrust   | `-25`                |
| üò† Dislike    | Strong distrust            | `-50`                |
| ü§¨ Hate       | Fully untrusted, block     | `-100`               |


**Use Case 2: Contextual Filtering**

To filter content within a specific category, or filter specific types of content :

*   **Categories:** Filter by `category="news"`, `category="music"`, or `category="video"` to prioritize content.
*   **Language:** Filter by `lang="fr"` to show language relevant categories.
*   **Context-Aware Filtering:** Combine scores with keywords, tags, or user settings to match the current context.
*   **Algorithme :** The formula `trust(B)=math.sqrt(trust(A,B)√ótrust(User,A))` can be changed to only take into account direct friends, or if they are tagged using a specific keyword.
*   **UX:**  Show the user the category of content being filtered, and give them easy controls on how to tweak it.

The following JavaScript code snippet demonstrates how a client can calculate a relative trust score and display it to the user, it fetches the last rating given to a user, it calculates an average score, filtered by a category, and shows it on the UI.

```javascript
async function calculateRelativeTrustScore(targetPubKey, selectedCategory) {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
        let filter = {
            kinds: [33],
            "#p": [targetPubKey]
        };
        if (selectedCategory !== 'all' && selectedCategory !== 'general') {
            filter["#category"] = [selectedCategory];
        }

       relay.send(JSON.stringify(["REQ", trustReqId, filter]));

          let ratings = new Map();

        relay.onmessage = (event) => {
             const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
                if (data[0] === "EVENT") {
                      const event = data[2];
                       let rating = null;
                     event.tags.forEach(tag => {
                        if(tag[0] === 'rating'){
                            rating = parseFloat(tag[1])
                        }
                   });
                     if (rating !== null) {
                           ratings.set(event.pubkey, rating) // store ratings by authors, overwriting old values with new ones.
                      }
                }
                if (data[0] === "EOSE") {
                     let averageRating = null;
                        if (ratings.size > 0) {
                          const sum = Array.from(ratings.values()).reduce((acc, rating) => acc + rating, 0);
                           averageRating = sum / ratings.size;
                       }
                     resolve(averageRating)
                }
        }
          relay.onerror = (error) => {
              reject(error)
        };
    });
}

// Example of use
const myPubKey =  "c81e8b31dbac658a3f53cf57521d75c1035129c7ae80b364dcc5204b96f4657d"
const targetPubKey = "72a89258afb5a6ea94b6e680597bd049a2739f2448d4fb01439793444f6700d2"
const category = "news"
calculateRelativeTrustScore(targetPubKey, category).then(score => {
      if (score !== null) {
        console.log(`The relative trust score of ${targetPubKey} from ${myPubKey} in the category ${category} is ${score.toFixed(2)}`);
       // You could show that on the UI like this:  document.getElementById('trustScore').textContent = `Score: ${score.toFixed(2)}`
       } else {
         console.log("No score found")
        // document.getElementById('trustScore').textContent = 'N/A'
       }
})

```
